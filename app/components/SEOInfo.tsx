          SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
        </h2>

        <p className="relative py-[1rem] small:w-[80%] ml-auto">
          The SEO landscape is forever evolving, with search engines
          continuously refining their algorithms to present the most relevant
          and up-to-date results. Among the key factors influencing rankings is
          page speed; since 2021, Google has prioritised faster-loading
          websites. My approach leverages the latest web technologies to ensure
          that your website is optimised for speed, user experience, and
          customization, which are crucial for enhancing search engine rankings.

        <p className="relative py-[1rem] small:w-[80%] ml-auto">
          I enhance site content with Schema.org markupâ€”a coding standard that
          helps search engines understand the details of your website, such as
          the purpose of a page or the subject of an article. Additionally, I
          optimise images for quick loading and use advanced plugins and
          software to ensure optimal HTML markup, making your website more
          favorable in search engine evaluations.
        </p>
        <p className="relative py-[1rem] small:w-[80%] ml-auto">
          It&apos;s important to note the role of content quality in SEO
          success. While employing content writers and SEO specialists can
          certainly enhance your site&apos;s performance, I strongly leverage
          the powerful use of AI tools as a prime method to create compelling
          content that serves both SEO goals and user engagement.
